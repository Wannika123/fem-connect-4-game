### What I learned

I didn't learn anything new. But this project is extremely challenging, it really tests my JS and CSS skills. And it's probably the most complicated algorithm I've ever wrote. 

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBRqnSiq_VM) - Very good explanation of `requestAnimationFrame()`
